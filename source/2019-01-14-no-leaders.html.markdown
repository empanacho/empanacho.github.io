> Make it so

Things like [Forth Thinking](https://1scyem2bunjw1ghzsf1cjwwn-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/thinking-forth-color.pdf), [LOOP Programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LOOP_(programming_language)), [Rules for Biologically Inspired Adaptive Network Design](http://science.sciencemag.org/content/327/5964/439) and [the Tower of Hanoi Analogy](https://books.google.com.mx/books?id=3DocCGB0cRkC&pg=PT348&lpg=PT348&dq=hanoi+towers+steven+pinker&source=bl&ots=rYQQ7O7Nt_&sig=kUt4XqOZYs-5I4eHogbvXF2AODs&hl=en&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwijpqiLve7fAhVQ2qwKHUw7BQkQ6AEwB3oECAgQAQ#v=onepage&q=hanoi%20towers%20steven%20pinker&f=false) make me think that perhaps we are doing everything wrong.

Instead, we should think like mathematicians, we should be slow thinkers. Remove everything that rush us into get things done as fast as we can. Take our time. Yeah, life's too short but it will get shorter for everybody on this planet if we don't stop fast thinking.

The brain is a powerful machine but it's not perfect. We need to take our time.

Make it so.
