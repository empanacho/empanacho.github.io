    <p>
        I stumpled upon with <a href="https://adr.github.io/">this</a>: <em>An Architectural Decision (AD) is a software design choice that addresses a functional or non-functional requirement that is architecturally significant...</em> sold! you got my attention.
        I'm the kind of person who is always blaming me from the past. <em>WTF you were thinking, man!</em><em>Seriously!?</em><label for="sn-34" class="sidenote-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-34" class="sidenote-toggle">
        <span class="sidenote left">
            I have a Notion account. I have my calendar full of activity cards of the day but I find it odd to have there. This, ADR, should be in the repository.
        </span>
    </p>

    <p>
        Since I'm learning Rust I thought it was a good idea to create a <em>cargo</em> command to create an ADR. I looked in <a href="https://crates.io">crates.io</a> and there was none. YEIIIII!

        So, I created it. It's working. I marked it as done in my todo list. Felt good.
