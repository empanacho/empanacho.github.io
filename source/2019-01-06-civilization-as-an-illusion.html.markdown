> Because this is the end of civilization! People like you don't want to work or learn anything because they're too busy with their remote control television or playing with their hula-hoops! And before you know it, that's where we're at!

As far as I can tell what's hold on this civilization is lying. To lie, we need some sort of communication. A channel where information flows. But information is not enough. Some sort of consciousness is neccesary.

In fact, I'm with Jaynes. To be conscious it takes what you least expect.

It is once we learned to talk to each other that the gods were away. It is when we created the laws that a civilization was born. To hold millions, a mechanism like laws or a constitution was enough. It is enough.

But all that it's an illusion, I believe. It only takes a few thoughts to release that this civilization is hang on a thread.

So, when will we start over?
