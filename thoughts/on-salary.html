        I don't understand the salary negotiation strategies or salary negotiations for that matter. It makes sense, I pressume, if we taking into consideration that we are still in the jungle and we make
        of things as the only way we can: <em>The weak are meat and the strong do eat</em><label for="sn-29" class="sidenote-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-29" class="sidenote-toggle">

            I love very much the way Tom Hanks spits those words in Cloud Atlas. You can feel the meaning right there.

        Do you know that plants go to war? Those plants that were being eating by pests and did not evolve any defense mechanism are no longer part of reality.
        Stress, in order words, force some plants to evolve <em>chemical compounds that serve as toxins, signal an escalating attack, and solicit help from unlikely allies</em><label for="sn-29" class="sidenote-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-29" class="sidenote-toggle">

        </span>. Within us, there is a constant war going on and yet we perceive ourselves as individuals. Before this so called civilization, we had to worry about eating, mating, sleeping and not get eating. Now, we have created a whole new best. This... system of ours baffles me every day.

        I see the economy as the humanmade jungle at least in the capitalist context. Communism seems too advanced for a monkey in a suit.

    <table>
        <caption>A naive comparison between humanmade jungle vs nature.</caption>
        <thead>
            <tr>
                <th>Humanmade</th>

        <tbody>
            <tr>
                <td>Those with capital, can continue living</td>
                <td>Those with skills, can continue another day</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Those with more money, can make more money, eat better, have more options</td>
                <td>Those stronger, get to eat more, mate, and be stronger</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Those with more money, can work less, less worries</td>
                <td>Those stronger, can be lazy and not get eaten</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Those with more money, can have better health</td>
                <td>Those stronger, can live longer</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Those with more money are more powerful</td>
                <td>Those stronger rule</td>

        There are more analogies and yeah some might not be a right example but I think you can get the idea. This is a jungle and if you want to play the game, you gotta know the rules<label for="sn-30" class="sidenote-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-30" class="sidenote-toggle">
        <span class="sidenote left">
            You can also not participate and go back to the actual jungle. It's most likely better. I hope one day to go back and be a hunter-gatherer.

        Now, money. It's the energy you need in this game to keep on going. One way to <em>earn</em> it is by spend actual energy. You can also steal, cheat, or be the President of Mexico. Apparently, every single president steal.
        If we consider the <em>legal</em> way, then we are talking about a salary. You do this for me and in return I give you a salary. Salary can be a representation of value... maybe it's all there is, I dunno, I'm not a bloody economist.
        If you are a coal miner and you get the coal, you get a salary. The value is in the coal and somehow you, the miner, get a tiny bit of that value. The owner(s) of the company get(s) more value by doing... something. Yeah, to me, it makes no sense but whatever I'm not a social warrior, I'm a coward and I'm here to talk about salary negotiations and how I don't understand them.

        At some point the coal miner, let's call him John, wants a raise because well it's stupid to live in a society with that kind of salary. The company hears John request and the negotiation starts.
        Hold it. Why it has to be negotiation? No sense. In order for John to continue surviving he needs the money. In order the company to make more money it needs Johness and Joanes.

        <mark>TODO</mark> In the long run, we all get fucked in the ass. So, we need to find a balance. Otherwise, workers can stop doing stuff, by numbers they are more. Although, there are far more poor people, why the revolution hasn't started? Maybe we are too compliance..?<br/>
        <mark>TODO</mark> If salaries for certain jobs say Software Engineer are getting higher (because of the market or whatever) and companies are not willing to pay because too expensive... how is that the owners can make way more? What's this really about?<br/>
        <mark>TODO</mark> Naturally, in this capitalist system, to make sense, there has to be difference in capital or value or in other words there cannot be a population where everyone is rich. It's like saying you were born in a world where every one is happy... you can only be happy in relation to the opposite. Is it therefore inevitable to have a capitalist system? <br/>
        <mark>TODO</mark> If we assume an utopy is possible, do we really want it? <br/>
        <mark>TODO</mark> Companies demands can be throw back at them and the demands will be dropped. Why and how to fix this? is it possible to fix it?<br/>
        <mark>TODO</mark> Is it about power? or about death?<br/>
        <mark>TODO</mark> Revisit content and fix typos and thoughts
