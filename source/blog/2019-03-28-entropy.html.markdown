The voice in the back of your mind is telling you that there is an order you can accomplish. You see chaos and your OCD starts running through your veins.

Maybe it's the anxiety to know that nothing you can do, you will decay at some point. If you manage to hack your biology, the matter will decay eventually.

But for now, you want to control things, to give them an order.

You want to achieve negative entropy like life itself...

But entropy globally will increase... there no seems to be an escape...
