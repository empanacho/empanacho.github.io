    <p>
        I like games. I like them very much. I recently had a tattoo made in my right forearm to illustrate my love and admiration for <a href="https://www.guerrilla-games.com/play/horizon" alt="Horizon: Zero Dawn"><em>Horizon: Zero Down</em></a>
        specially for Aloy. If I were a woman, I would be Aloy hence a tattoo of her in my arm.
    </p>
    <p>
        I also love games like <a href="http://www.zachtronics.com/shenzhen-io/" alt="Shenzhen I/O">Shenzhen I/O</a> and <a href="https://www.factorio.com/" alt="Factorio">Factorio</a> which leads me to automatization. I'm not sure
        we want to automate everything anymore<label for="sn-8" class="sidenote-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-8" class="sidenote-toggle">
        <span class="sidenote">
            I found this in <a href="https://blog.jessfraz.com/post/the-art-of-automation/">Jess's blog</a>. I'm sure she wasn't advocating to automate everything but it got me thinking.

        We gain more time but my question is for what. Man k√∂nnte argumentieren for whatever you want
        which sounds like a great answer and one could imagine all things we would wanted to be done but I don't think that's the case.
    </p>
    <p>
        Why do you think new years resolutions are hard? 
    </p>
    <p>
        Why do you think people need religion?
    </p>
    <p>
        Why do you think <em>gringos</em> are afraid of robots or <mark>bad hombres</mark> taking their jobs?
    </p>
    <p>
        I think the answer to all those questions comes from the same root: <ins>humans need meaning</ins>. 
    </p>
    <p>
        They literally are made of meat but this is thinking meat. And the part that does this thinking is a 
        pattern recognization machine. To work, it needs input. It has sensors of all kinds. But if you deprive
        those sensors from input, it goes haywire.
    </p>
    <p>
        It is not that simple since there are many layers but the underlying mechanics is like that. Finding meaning
        or the act of finding meaning is in itself a pattern. From A to B. If there is no A nor B, then what to do?
    </p>
    <p>
        The ape-descended being start asking questions... remember this is a thinking meat. But this thinking meat
        most likely has no answers. And this is not good. It's not good because the thinking meat cannot go back
        to not thinking unless it's a thinking meat monk or something.
    </p>
    <p>
        So, back to automatization. People need to struggle. Then what to automate? What we need to leave untouched?
        Keine Ahnung. But my bet is it will happening the same as we are currently living: a society where religion is disappearing
        and humans are losing <mark>ground</mark> and most humans need a ground <em>or they will go haywire</em>.
