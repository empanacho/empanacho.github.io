     Well, you get here. And for that I'll tell you something to be either entertained or bored, your choice.

     You probably know the expression "Know thyself". I've been 35 years on this planet and until now I found
     my "calling". I do not believe there are such things but I do believe we can choose our future (part of it).
     So, I have this vision where we can conquer the galaxy. Although I'd say "I" because I'll be alone in the beginning but my
     hope is that there are crazy human beings who happens to want the same.
     It's not simple and most likely "I" won't make it but I want to play the game.

     Our existence is so ephemeral in comparison with most things in the Universe or Multiverse.
     It is also meaningless.
     You probably won't understand this BUT those two things are the fuel to my
     silly existence.

     "My life extends far beyond the limitations of me..."

      <p>I tried the social tools, the popular ones. I succumb into egotistical actitude such as selfies and such. I didn't like it. It made me feel weird.</p>

<p>Mama used to kill my selfish behavoir causing traumas that I think are the main reason of why I couldn't be part of the digital society.</p>

<p>In latest attemps, I just got frustated by the need of people have instant responses and then doing the exact opposite to others. Didn't make sense to me.</p>

<p>Also hated the notifications and constant interruptions. I want to be bored.</p>

<p>I don't care about people and their constant need to be relevant.</p>

<p>A small dosis, I presume, is needed, though. Like this blog. Although, I use it more like a place to drop all the shit that I have inside to keep me sane, I think.</p>
