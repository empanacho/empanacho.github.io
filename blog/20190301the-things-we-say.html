     Well, you get here. And for that I'll tell you something to be either entertained or bored, your choice.

     You probably know the expression "Know thyself". I've been 35 years on this planet and until now I found
     my "calling". I do not believe there are such things but I do believe we can choose our future (part of it).
     So, I have this vision where we can conquer the galaxy. Although I'd say "I" because I'll be alone in the beginning but my
     hope is that there are crazy human beings who happens to want the same.
     It's not simple and most likely "I" won't make it but I want to play the game.

     Our existence is so ephemeral in comparison with most things in the Universe or Multiverse.
     It is also meaningless.
     You probably won't understand this BUT those two things are the fuel to my
     silly existence.

     "My life extends far beyond the limitations of me..."

      <p>The main work you have as an adult is to fix the terrible job your parents did (if you were unlucky to have them). I don't blame them. They couldn't have known better. Who does it?
One of the things you have to <strong>unlearn</strong> or the bubble you need desperately need to burst is this: lying is the foundation of this dogdamn society. We lie all the time to ourselves, to everybody else, to our beloved ones. You name it.</p>

<p>Love. I remembered when I used to believe in such thing, Disney style. Jeez, all the lies women were told. Why? Why do we do that to ourselves? Why do we insist in telling things that clear are false but we say it anyway to create the illusion, to create the storytelling that something mattersâ€¦ Why? We should be told since the beginning all the shit will be in years to come.
Let me be clear, I'm not against fantasy/fiction. I think it's great. But living by fiction it might be bad in the long run. Take religion, for example, it's great, I believe, but we shouldn't cover our eyes and deny reality.</p>

<p>Maybe we should indeed deny our programming. Use these powerful brains to against our nature but for real. You might think we are doing in right now but in fact, we are just monkeys in suits.</p>

<p>Pay attention to the things you say, really, listening to yourself.</p>

I'd consider myself a realist, alright? But in philosophical terms I'm what's called a pessimist... I think human consciousness is a tragic misstep in evolution. We became too self-aware. Nature created an aspect of nature separate from itself - we are creatures that should not exist by natural law... We are things that labor under the illusion of having a self, that accretion of sensory experience and feelings, programmed with total assurance that we are each somebody, when in fact everybody's nobody... I think the honorable thing for our species to do is to deny our programming. Stop reproducing, walk hand in hand into extinction - one last midnight, brothers and sisters opting out of a raw deal.
