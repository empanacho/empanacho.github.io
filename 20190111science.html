Well, you get here. And for that I'll tell you something to be either entertained or bored, your choice.

You probably know the expression "Know thyself". I've been 35 years on this planet and until now I found
my "calling". I do not believe there are such things but I do believe we can choose our future (part of it).
So, I have this vision where we can conquer the galaxy. Although I'd say I because I'll be alone in the beginning but my
hope is that there are crazy human beings who happens to want the same.
It's not simple and most likely I won't make it but I want to play the game.

Our existence is so ephemeral in comparison with most things in the Universe or Multiverse.
It is also meaningless.
You probably won't understand this BUT those two things are the fuel to my
silly existence.

  <p>We fight inequality in knowledge access across the world. The scientific knowledge should be available for every person regardless of their income, social status, geographical location and etc.</p>

<p>I remember that I was discourage to going into Astronomy. In his defense, my father was just protecting me. He wanted a future where I can survive after his gone. I think that shows the roots of the problem with this civilization.</p>

<p>I remember I got into PhD program because I was in love with science, however, I got discourage by watching how things where done in the institution I was researching. In their defense, their were looking after themselves (money and ego). So I dropped out after 4 years of working.</p>

<p>Now, I'm working on a project that will take me at least 50 years. Projects of such magnitude clearly cannot be done by one person, me. I'm well aware that I need to find other people. I depend on them. While trying to find such people, I stumbled upon the same hidden issues I mentioned before.</p>

<p>Why do we have to pay for scientific papers?</p>

<p>Why do we want to have a civilization?</p>

<p>Why do we say we are superior species when we clearly live by the rules of Nature?</p>

<p>Our civilization is based on so many illusions what we are not willing to challenge. Is it our nature to be followers?</p>

<p>How is that that a country with 60% of poverty is ruled by the minority? By numbers, they should take the country.</p>

<p>Why we are still bicameral men?</p>
