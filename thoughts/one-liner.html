    <h2 id="one-liner">One Liner</h2>

    <p>
        I recently found <a href="https://github.com/duysqubix/MuOxi">MuOxi</a>, a MUD game engine written in Rust. It reminds of my days of MUDs in the lately '90s and early '00s.
        I spent a few nights with strangers around the global having epic text-based adventures. Good times.
    </p>

    <p>
        Maybe it was nostalgy but I decided to contribute to the project. It's open source and I noticed they are not using docker for at least development. They are using Redis and Postgres.
        So, I thought it could be a good start if I dockerize<label for="sn-33" class="sidenote-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-33" class="sidenote-toggle">
        <span class="sidenote left">
            I stopped using docker months ago. I stumbled upon a project that got into my nerve. It took eons to start. Puff! It was actually easy to work as per usual.
        </span> the engine. <a href="https://github.com/duysqubix/MuOxi/pull/19">So I did it</a>. It's a working progress. I'm almost finished, though.
    </p>

    <p>
        While working on the PR, I noticed the engine was failing. The connection with Redis was failing apparently. I checked Redis was up and running. It was.  I checked and double-checked it again,
        nothing. Something told me I was doing something wrong, hmmmm. Usually it's something simple and stupid. I knew I would have a <em>Duh!</em> moment.
    </p>

    <p>
        In the meantime, I wanted to test the connection with redis. I knew it was running and the open port was 6379. I didn't want to install a redis client in my environment and I didn't want to test it
        from the inside because it'd be useless.
    </p>

    <p>
        So, I found a <em>one liner</em> out in the jungle and I loved it.
    </p>

    <div style="background: #272822; overflow:auto;width:auto;color:white;border:solid gray;border-width:.1em .1em .1em .8em;padding:.2em .6em;">
        <pre style="background-color:transparent;margin: 0; line-height: 125%"><span style="color: #f8f8f2">$ </span><span style="color: #f92672">(</span><span style="color: #f8f8f2">printf</span> <span style="color: #e6db74">&quot;PING\r\n&quot;</span>;<span style="color: #f92672">)</span> | nc 0.0.0.0 6379
+PONG
        </pre>
    </div>

    <p>
        Once I was sure it was running and open. I was 110% sure I was doing something stupid. I checked the <code>docker-compose.override.yml</code>. The network was defined. The server was defined. Then
        I checked <code>docker-compose.yml</code>. And that was the <em>Duh!</em> moment: both services, Postgres and Redis, were defined <b>but</b> the network was not. 
        I added it to both services, stop the containers and run it again.

        BOOM! it was working.
