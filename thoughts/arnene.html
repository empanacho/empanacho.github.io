    <p>
        In the following weeks, I'll be self-studying how to create a RNN. The repository can be found <a href="https://github.com/thelastinuit/arnene" alt="Recurrent Neural Network">here</a>.

    <div class="definition">
        <b>Artificial Neural Network</b>, usually called <em>neural network</em> is a collection of
        connected units or <em>nodes</em> called <em>artificial neurons</em>.
    </div>

    <div class="definition">
        <b>Artificial Neuron</b> is a function, a mathematical function, that models
        a biological neuron. It performs a weighted sum on incoming signals, adds a threshold
        or bias term to thhis value to yield a net input, and maps this last value through
        an activation function to compute its own activation.
    </div>

    <div class="definition">
        <b>Threshold</b> is a value added to the weighted sum of inputs into a artificial neuron,
        which forms the neuron's net input.
    </div>

    <div class="definition">
        <b>Layer</b> is group of artificial neurons with a specific function and are processed
        as a whole.
    </div>

    <div class="definition">
        <b>Learning</b>, in a general sense, is when some task is being improved through experience.
    </div>

    <div class="definition">
        <b>Learning rule</b> is the algorithm used for modifying the weights.
    </div>

    <div class="definition">
        <b>Weight</b> is the connection strengths between artificial neurons. It can
        be excitatory (positive) or inhibitory (negative).
    </div>

    <div class="definition">
        <b>Bias</b> is the amount that the incoming neural activations must exceed in order
        for a artificial neuron to fire.
    </div>
