        That title is most likely an oversimplification<label for="sn-31" class="sidenote-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-31" class="sidenote-toggle">
        <span class="sidenote left">
            but we tend to do that because it makes things easier. Layers over layers. Sometimes I wonder if the organization of reality actually determines the organization of neurons. If so,
            would reorganization of neurons change our perspective of reality? Wouldn't then new knowledge change our perspective? <em>I'm tripping again...</em>
        </span>. In Unix-like operating systems, what it says is, everything is <em>represented</em> by a <em>file</em>.

        Take for example the above. I'm running <code>top</code> as an example. You can see that the <em>PID</em> is <em>577</em>. This process running right now<label for="sn-32" class="sidenote-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-32" class="sidenote-toggle">
        <span class="sidenote">
            Isn't that fascinating? The future is unknown. The past is gone. The present doesn't exist.
        </span>. We can see some details at <code>/proc/PID/</code>. For now, let's do the status.
    </p>

    <figure>
        <img src="proc.png" alt="proc" width="600">
        <figcaption>
            Proc status for PID 577
        </figcaption>
    </figure>

    <p>
        Even though it's a process running you can <em>see</em> its file representation. You can do even more i.e. <code>/proc/PID/fd/1</code> and see <code>stdout</code> among other things.

        All that makes me thing about Category Theory but I think it has become an unhealthy obssesion.
