     Well, you get here. And for that I'll tell you something to be either entertained or bored, your choice.

     You probably know the expression "Know thyself". I've been 35 years on this planet and until now I found
     my "calling". I do not believe there are such things but I do believe we can choose our future (part of it).
     So, I have this vision where we can conquer the galaxy. Although I'd say "I" because I'll be alone in the beginning but my
     hope is that there are crazy human beings who happens to want the same.
     It's not simple and most likely "I" won't make it but I want to play the game.

     Our existence is so ephemeral in comparison with most things in the Universe or Multiverse.
     It is also meaningless.
     You probably won't understand this BUT those two things are the fuel to my
     silly existence.

     "My life extends far beyond the limitations of me..."

      <p>Yes. There is no mystery that I don't have any appreciation for my life. Saying that to people comes like a shocking revelation. My sort of resentment against my species is increasing every single day.</p>

<p>We blew it. We, us. We fucked it up. I don't believe in the gods but right now I'm willing to take a leap of faith and believe there is a divine salvation.</p>

<p>We have it all. All, I tell ya. Why the fuck did we go our way down the trees? Why.</p>

<p>I am what you may call a pessimist (in phisosophical terms). I am. And I can only forsee terrible scenarios. My concern is not us, the adults, is the the young ones. They might believe in hell sooner. Hell on Earth. Jeez.</p>

<p>Maybe there are aliens watching us and one of them will reach us out.</p>

<p>Or maybe this is it. This pale blue dot (is it still blue?) will be no mo'…</p>

<p>Dogdamnit. I did want to travel to other planets. Go to the unknown. And now all I will see is the terrors of a species consuming itself.</p>

<p>Or maybe 7 billion human beings will come with a solution… maybe we will be come a super organism and conquer the galaxy once it for all.</p>

<p>Looking forward.</p>
