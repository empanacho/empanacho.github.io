Well, you get here. And for that I'll tell you something to be either entertained or bored, your choice.

You probably know the expression "Know thyself". I've been 35 years on this planet and until now I found
my "calling". I do not believe there are such things but I do believe we can choose our future (part of it).
So, I have this vision where we can conquer the galaxy. Although I'd say I because I'll be alone in the beginning but my
hope is that there are crazy human beings who happens to want the same.
It's not simple and most likely I won't make it but I want to play the game.

Our existence is so ephemeral in comparison with most things in the Universe or Multiverse.
It is also meaningless.
You probably won't understand this BUT those two things are the fuel to my
silly existence.

<p>Things like <a href="https://1scyem2bunjw1ghzsf1cjwwn-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/thinking-forth-color.pdf">Forth Thinking</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LOOP_(programming_language)">LOOP Programming</a>, <a href="http://science.sciencemag.org/content/327/5964/439">Rules for Biologically Inspired Adaptive Network Design</a> and <a href="https://books.google.com.mx/books?id=3DocCGB0cRkC&amp;pg=PT348&amp;lpg=PT348&amp;dq=hanoi+towers+steven+pinker&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=rYQQ7O7Nt_&amp;sig=kUt4XqOZYs-5I4eHogbvXF2AODs&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwijpqiLve7fAhVQ2qwKHUw7BQkQ6AEwB3oECAgQAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=hanoi%20towers%20steven%20pinker&amp;f=false">the Tower of Hanoi Analogy</a> make me think that perhaps we are doing everything wrong.</p>

<p>Instead, we should think like mathematicians, we should be slow thinkers. Remove everything that rush us into get things done as fast as we can. Take our time. Yeah, life's too short but it will get shorter for everybody on this planet if we don't stop fast thinking.</p>

<p>The brain is a powerful machine but it's not perfect. We need to take our time.</p>

<p>Make it so.</p>
