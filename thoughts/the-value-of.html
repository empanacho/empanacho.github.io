        That is because I don't think <em>there are wrong feelings, maybe there are wrong actions</em>. I try not to get involved<label for="sn-14" class="sidenote-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-14" class="sidenote-toggle">

            In college, friends called me <em>The Opinionless</em>.

        A couple of years ago, I got into a company that outsource developers for companies in need for workforce in the U.S.A, let's called the Ninja Company. The business model of the Ninja company is to 
        outsource <em>great latinamerican developers</em> to work for companies in the U.S.A. who presumably can't afford the price of a U.S.A. developer. Somehow, the Ninja company believes they are providing
        top quality development<label for="sn-15" class="sidenote-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-15" class="sidenote-toggle">
        <span class="sidenote">
            I believe there is great talent everywhere. I'm not bashing latinoamerican developers.
        </span> for a good price. The Ninja company said <em>it's fair</em>. The Ninja company says this like they are running a fucking charity<label for="sn-16" class="sidenote-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-16" class="sidenote-toggle">
        <span class="sidenote left">
            I'm not bashing charities either. This is a fucking rant. I'm pissed off.
        </span>.
    </p>

    <p>
        Natürlich, the Ninja company provides you with a contract. One of the clausules is that once you work for a company through them, you cannot work for them unless is through them, always. 
        <b>A.Y.F.K.M?</b>. Not only they pay way less than a U.S.A. developer, they also reserve the right to block your future collaborations. I'm assuming it's a way for them to protect themselves... really?
    </p>
    <p>
        I accepted the contract, anyway. I needed the money but it got me thinking. I worked for them around 7 months. I saw all kinds of things: white lies of what I'm capable of doing, zero process related to IT stuff, 
        the interview process to work for them was... quite simple. I doubt it provides you insights of what a developer can actually do.
        But hey... I'm not a saint. It worked for me and it paid the bills. I'm part of the problem. Because of people like me the industry abuses developers<label for="sn-17" class="sidenote-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-17" class="sidenote-toggle">
        <span class="sidenote">
            Even though I disagree with literally everything Trump does and says, I do believe he was right about why U.S.A IT companies hire people from outside, they are cheaper.
        </span>.
    </p>
    <p>
        Lucky me, I got a job in mother Deutschland so I quit and move to the next adventure. While I was working in Germany, one of the client I had in the Ninja company looked for me. I honestly blocked
        that part of the contract of not working for the companies (I guess I was so pissed off that I erased from my memory). We talked and we agreed on a price (still low, though).
    </p>
    <p>
        In the beginning, I noticed that the client, let's called it Scott, was very insecure about its capacity to make code. It didn't bother me because who the fuck am I to judge such thing. So I let it pass.
        At that moment we were three developers. During a couple of months, Scott fired the other two. It was just me. Apparently I was doing a great job (and cheaper too). There were a few occasions where
        I saved Scott's ass. And Scott did recognize that. However, at some point Scott found code that it was <em>a mess</em>. Scott decided to code the frontend even though Scott knew shit about design patterns in anything.
        I let it pass only to learn a few weeks later that the code I did I needed to put it back on. Scott said <em>I didn't understand it</em><label for="sn-18" class="sidenote-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-18" class="sidenote-toggle">
        <span class="sidenote left">
            No shit, Sherlock, really? Fucking asshole.
        </span>. Did I start coding again the frontend? No. I was tutoring Scott on how to do things from time to time. At that moment, I started to believe there was a hidden reason.
    </p>
    <p>
        Later, Scott got a external project contract (I was working on Scott's project). The project was sold within an unbelievable and unreasonable time scope. And of course, he was getting paying.
        I dunno how much but Scott said <em>goooood money</em>. The frontend was being coded by Scott<label for="sn-19" class="sidenote-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-19" class="sidenote-toggle">
        <span class="sidenote">
            I decided not to look the code. I assumed it was written <em>con las patas</em>.
        </span>. Me, I got the backend.
    </p>
    <p>
        The project had no structure when it comes to sprints, user stories, design ready, prototype. For month, the requirements where changing <mark>a fucking lot</mark>. The project, to me, was doomed.
        Again, I'm not innocent. I needed the money<label for="sn-20" class="sidenote-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-20" class="sidenote-toggle">
        <span class="sidenote left">
            I wasn't getting more money, of course. My time was distributed into Scott's projects and this new project.
        </span>.
    </p>

    <p>
        At some point he got a DevOps guy from Ukraine to handle some things of Scott's projects. Once, Scott started complaning about some things that was total lies<label for="sn-21" class="sidenote-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-21" class="sidenote-toggle">
        <span class="sidenote">
            Scott speaks in a way that according to Scott, it means nothing. Yeah, thousands of years of languages evolving to come to the conclusion that words mean nothing. The fucking fuck. 
            How to make sense of what Scott is saying if it means nothing? How the fucking how?
        </span>. Poor Ukraine guy. I felt sorry about him.
    </p>

    <p>
        Back to the project Scott took. During the whole bloody project, Scott complained about how the product manager was so stupid doing his work. Nowadays, I believe Scott was projecting itself. It
        was literally word for word of what Scott was doing totally wrong. Scott capacity to be self-critic baffles me today. Everyone was fucking wrong except him<label for="sn-22" class="sidenote-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-22" class="sidenote-toggle">
        <span class="sidenote left">
            I'm starting to see why people see <em>gringos</em> the way they see them: assholes.
        </span>.
    </p>

    <p>
        Then something happened. I think he knew I was pissed off that Scott showed off some abandonment issue. One day I was just busy but Scott went haywire. Scott started saying shit about stuff like a 
        crazy conspiracy theorist. Scott was connecting shit that in the beginning I gave Scott the benefit of the doubt. On a second thought I realized Scott was being bat-shit crazy.
    </p>

    <p>
        After that day, I just went say-just-the-minimum-necessary mode. I didn't want to feed the troll. I just wanted to work, get my things done and get paid for it. Dealing with insecurity issue and what-not
        was about my rate.
    </p>

    <p>
        Scott noticed it and sort of did the same. Until one day he started bashing me. For the record, I'm not perfect, I have my issues. In my defense I was dealing with a couple Scott's projects plus that 
        other project of Scott. The switching between work was not good specially when Scott's skill for making the decision was... well, shit. So my flow got fucked up every single day. Honestly, I dunno
        how I manage to code <em>something good enough</em>. But that's my fault, I should've stopped Scott but I didn't.
    </p>

    <p>
        So, Scott was bashing me on my stuff with zero regarding of the situation. It was literaly a personal attack. The bashing didn't bother me. I don't care about people's verbal attacks. What got me
        was that I realized how fucking delusional Scott was.
    </p>

    <p>
        And that was it. I just quit. I couldn't take it any more.
    </p>

    <p>
        Of course, things aren't that simple. I can't just blame others specially when I was there there on my own choosing. Nobody put a gun against my head. It made me realized about a few things. 
    </p>

    <p>
        Why companies/bosses do that? Why the take advantage of the employees? Don't they see that a happy employee brings them more income? If the whole point is to increase the capital? Boy, I think 
        most companies are doing a bad job. If they are making billions, I bet they can get more money by making employees happy. I'm premise is that the productivity increases.
    </p>

    <p>
        Why is that the salaries are sooo disproportionated? How is that we as a group decided to value this more than that? I'm not trying to fix the economy. What the fuck do I know about shit. However,
        I have always find gold and jewelry stupid. I dunno why people value things like that. It's not like they are using gold as a superconductor<label for="sn-23" class="sidenote-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-23" class="sidenote-toggle">
        <span class="sidenote">
            ARE THEY!?!?
        </span>.
    </p>

    <p>
        Sometimes I think that Communism doesn't work because you need smart animals and humans are full of biases and ego.
    </p>

    <p>
        How is that a fucking pen costs more than 2 month of food and rent in Mexico? Why the fuck rice in Mexico is cheaper than in other countries? I know the usual answers but I think that's not an answer.
        It's more like a justification to things keep being like that.
    </p>

    <p>
        I dunno how but my brains is yelling right now: <mark>We can't keep growing like this. We can't keep having this progress. Progress is the greatest illusion of this human civilization.</mark>
    </p>

    <p>
        And on that note. I will consider this rant done. I'm done.
