> We fight inequality in knowledge access across the world. The scientific knowledge should be available for every person regardless of their income, social status, geographical location and etc.

I remember that I was discourage to going into Astronomy. In his defense, my father was just protecting me. He wanted a future where I can survive after his gone. I think that shows the roots of the problem with this civilization.

I remember I got into PhD program because I was in love with science, however, I got discourage by watching how things where done in the institution I was researching. In their defense, their were looking after themselves (money and ego). So I dropped out after 4 years of working.

Now, I'm working on a project that will take me at least 50 years. Projects of such magnitude clearly cannot be done by one person, me. I'm well aware that I need to find other people. I depend on them. While trying to find such people, I stumbled upon the same hidden issues I mentioned before.

Why do we have to pay for scientific papers?

Why do we want to have a civilization?

Why do we say we are superior species when we clearly live by the rules of Nature?

Our civilization is based on so many illusions what we are not willing to challenge. Is it our nature to be followers?

How is that that a country with 60% of poverty is ruled by the minority? By numbers, they should take the country.

Why we are still bicameral men?
