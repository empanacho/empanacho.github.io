     Well, you get here. And for that I'll tell you something to be either entertained or bored, your choice.

     You probably know the expression "Know thyself". I've been 35 years on this planet and until now I found
     my "calling". I do not believe there are such things but I do believe we can choose our future (part of it).
     So, I have this vision where we can conquer the galaxy. Although I'd say "I" because I'll be alone in the beginning but my
     hope is that there are crazy human beings who happens to want the same.
     It's not simple and most likely "I" won't make it but I want to play the game.

     Our existence is so ephemeral in comparison with most things in the Universe or Multiverse.
     It is also meaningless.
     You probably won't understand this BUT those two things are the fuel to my
     silly existence.

     "My life extends far beyond the limitations of me..."

      <p>The voice in the back of your mind is telling you that there is an order you can accomplish. You see chaos and your OCD starts running through your veins.</p>

<p>Maybe it's the anxiety to know that nothing you can do, you will decay at some point. If you manage to hack your biology, the matter will decay eventually.</p>

<p>But for now, you want to control things, to give them an order.</p>

<p>You want to achieve negative entropy like life itself…</p>

<p>But entropy globally will increase… there no seems to be an escape…</p>
