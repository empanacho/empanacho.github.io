     Well, you get here. And for that I'll tell you something to be either entertained or bored, your choice.

     You probably know the expression "Know thyself". I've been 35 years on this planet and until now I found
     my "calling". I do not believe there are such things but I do believe we can choose our future (part of it).
     So, I have this vision where we can conquer the galaxy. Although I'd say I because I'll be alone in the beginning but my
     hope is that there are crazy human beings who happens to want the same.
     It's not simple and most likely I won't make it but I want to play the game.

     Our existence is so ephemeral in comparison with most things in the Universe or Multiverse.
     It is also meaningless.
     You probably won't understand this BUT those two things are the fuel to my
     silly existence.

     "My life extends far beyond the limitations of me..."

  <p>Because this is the end of civilization! People like you don't want to work or learn anything because they're too busy with their remote control television or playing with their hula-hoops! And before you know it, that's where we're at!</p>
</blockquote>

<p>As far as I can tell what's hold on this civilization is lying. To lie, we need some sort of communication. A channel where information flows. But information is not enough. Some sort of consciousness is neccesary.</p>

<p>In fact, I'm with Jaynes. To be conscious it takes what you least expect.</p>

<p>It is once we learned to talk to each other that the gods were away. It is when we created the laws that a civilization was born. To hold millions, a mechanism like laws or a constitution was enough. It is enough.</p>

<p>But all that it's an illusion, I believe. It only takes a few thoughts to release that this civilization is hang on a thread.</p>

<p>So, when will we start over?</p>
