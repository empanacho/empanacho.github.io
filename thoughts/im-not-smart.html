    <h2 id="not-smart">I'm not smart</h2> 
    <p>
        Like any developer, I have done a lot of interviews. The interviews are a bit diff, I think, 
        since I have no computer science degree. I'm a physicist by training. Some people may think
        that probably means I'm smart. I am not.

        One of the things I learned as a child was that I'm not smart. I'm not wise. I'm not intelligent.
        There is nothing special about me and there are far more better people than me in any area.
        I forced myself to live with that. It's hard since family and friends say otherwise but that, I 
        believe, does not help me at all.
    </p>
    <p>
        At my age, I've learned to live with that. It's sort of sad since I know I'll be behind. I'll
        be left behind. It's hard to accept that but I'm ok with the logic of how Nature/Reality seems to work.

        I recently had to decline to continue with a process with a company because its process involved 
        challenges like the ones you have at Facebook, Amazon, Google, Microsoft, you name it. They also
        wanted to know how much time it took me to solve the problem. To me, the company wanted the best of
        the best which, well, I am not<label for="sn-6" class="sidenote-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-6" class="sidenote-toggle">

            I have also the idea that those sort of interview processes provide so little information about the person but I think it's my ego trying to not to get hurt.

        I could have fake it. Nowadays, you can find anything on the internet and I'm positive I could have 
        found the solution. To what end? I'm not smart. Cheating won't make me smart, I think. It was not even
        about being honest. I doubt I'd be smart by cheating.
    </p>
    <p>
        I like to believe that what I have cultivated is, that for most things, I don't need to be smart, I just 
        have to be careful. I doubt I'm the best but I do think I best myself every day.
