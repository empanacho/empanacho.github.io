Well, you get here. And for that I'll tell you something to be either entertained or bored, your choice.

You probably know the expression "Know thyself". I've been 35 years on this planet and until now I found
my "calling". I do not believe there are such things but I do believe we can choose our future (part of it).
So, I have this vision where we can conquer the galaxy. Although I'd say I because I'll be alone in the beginning but my
hope is that there are crazy human beings who happens to want the same.
It's not simple and most likely I won't make it but I want to play the game.

Our existence is so ephemeral in comparison with most things in the Universe or Multiverse.
It is also meaningless.
You probably won't understand this BUT those two things are the fuel to my
silly existence.

  <p>It can scarcely be denied that the supreme goal of all theory is to make the irreducible basic elements as simple and as few as possible without having to surrender the adequate representation of a single datum of experience</p>

  <p>It's really more intelligent to be able to simplify things than to complicate them. Even if some people think it makes you look stupid</p>

<p>It took me 35 years to understand that simples are actually simple but not the simple you might have in mind.</p>

<p>With everything happening around, you hear a lot of stuff that seems to be the answer. However, things are simple but not that simple. I understand that revenge and hate might lead your actions but we have two ways of thinking. The slow and the fast. Slow down. Abide. The dude abidesâ€¦</p>
