The main work you have as an adult is to fix the terrible job your parents did (if you were unlucky to have them). I don't blame them. They couldn't have known better. Who does it?
One of the things you have to **unlearn** or the bubble you need desperately need to burst is this: lying is the foundation of this dogdamn society. We lie all the time to ourselves, to everybody else, to our beloved ones. You name it.

Love. I remembered when I used to believe in such thing, Disney style. Jeez, all the lies women were told. Why? Why do we do that to ourselves? Why do we insist in telling things that clear are false but we say it anyway to create the illusion, to create the storytelling that something matters... Why? We should be told since the beginning all the shit will be in years to come.
Let me be clear, I'm not against fantasy/fiction. I think it's great. But living by fiction it might be bad in the long run. Take religion, for example, it's great, I believe, but we shouldn't cover our eyes and deny reality.

Maybe we should indeed deny our programming. Use these powerful brains to against our nature but for real. You might think we are doing in right now but in fact, we are just monkeys in suits.

Pay attention to the things you say, really, listening to yourself.

<blockquote>
I'd consider myself a realist, alright? But in philosophical terms I'm what's called a pessimist... I think human consciousness is a tragic misstep in evolution. We became too self-aware. Nature created an aspect of nature separate from itself - we are creatures that should not exist by natural law... We are things that labor under the illusion of having a self, that accretion of sensory experience and feelings, programmed with total assurance that we are each somebody, when in fact everybody's nobody... I think the honorable thing for our species to do is to deny our programming. Stop reproducing, walk hand in hand into extinction - one last midnight, brothers and sisters opting out of a raw deal.
