    <h2 id="humans">Humans, the final frontier</h2>
    <p>
        I have this crazy goal. So crazy that I think I just went mental.
        The physics of the goal is not the hard part to solve but rather humans, how to take humanity the next level
        and also be prepared for it... htf?<label for="sn-2" class="sidenote-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-2" class="sidenote-toggle">

            Obviously, to travel faster than light, to create wormholes, to contract the spacetime continuum, to find ways to get exotic matter, it is hard.
            But if I'm saying humans are the big challenge, it's because in my head is more easier to solve technical problems than humans and their egos/biology.
