     Well, you get here. And for that I'll tell you something to be either entertained or bored, your choice.

     You probably know the expression "Know thyself". I've been 35 years on this planet and until now I've found
     my "call". I do not believe there are such things but I do believe we can choose our future (part of it).
     So, I have this vision where I can conquer the galaxy. I say I because I´ll be alone in the beginning but my
     hope is that there are crazy human beings who happens to want the same.
     It's not simple and most likely I won't make it but I want to play the game.

     Our existence is so ephemeral in comparison with most things in the Universe or Multiverse.
     It is also meaningless.
     You probably won't understand this BUT those two things are the fuel to my
     silly existence.

     "My life extends far beyond the limitations of me..."

            Hey there, stranger.
        </p>
        <p>
            This is luis ignacio, a sort of human fascinated by dynamics of the spacetime continuum.

            I have my issues with titles, however, I'm well aware that we need labels to understand each other.
        </p>
        <p>
            So, I'm a <b>physicist</b>. I'm also an <b>electrical technician</b> and a <b>computer technician</b>.
        </p>
        <p>
            I live off of coding. I code backends in <b>Ruby</b>, sometimes I code with <b>Elixir</b> or <b>Go</b>. I also code frontends in <b>React</b> or <b>Angular</b>. I've created a few iOS apps with <b>Objective-C</b>.
        </p>
        <p>
            And, finally, I have my ways with <b>AWS</b>.

            I'm pondering
        </h3>
        <p>
            When \(a \ne 0\), there are two solutions to \(ax^2 + bx + c = 0\) and they are
            $$x = {-b \pm \sqrt{b^2-4ac} \over 2a}.$$
        </p>
        <p>
Mathematically speaking, yeah, it makes sense. What happens when this equation represents something in real life? I think this is similar to what happen to Dirac when he predicts anti-matter. Isn't that brilliant? That Dirac choose to believe the equation was right: there gotta be some particle which properties are exactly opposite to electron properties.
