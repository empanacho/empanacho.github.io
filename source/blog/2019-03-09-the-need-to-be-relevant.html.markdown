title: The need to be relevant

I tried the social tools, the popular ones. I succumb into egotistical actitude such as selfies and such. I didn't like it. It made me feel weird.

Mama used to kill my selfish behavoir causing traumas that I think are the main reason of why I couldn't be part of the digital society.

In latest attemps, I just got frustated by the need of people have instant responses and then doing the exact opposite to others. Didn't make sense to me.

Also hated the notifications and constant interruptions. I want to be bored.

I don't care about people and their constant need to be relevant.

A small dosis, I presume, is needed, though. Like this blog. Although, I use it more like a place to drop all the shit that I have inside to keep me sane, I think.
