Well, you get here. And for that I'll tell you something to be either entertained or bored, your choice.

You probably know the expression "Know thyself". I've been 35 years on this planet and until now I found
my "calling". I do not believe there are such things but I do believe we can choose our future (part of it).
So, I have this vision where we can conquer the galaxy. Although I'd say I because I'll be alone in the beginning but my
hope is that there are crazy human beings who happens to want the same.
It's not simple and most likely I won't make it but I want to play the game.

Our existence is so ephemeral in comparison with most things in the Universe or Multiverse.
It is also meaningless.
You probably won't understand this BUT those two things are the fuel to my
silly existence.

<p>Planning is one of those things that humans are into it. I don't know if the reason is fear of failing, death, disappointment, etc. Maybe it's because the brain is a pattern recognition machine and a plan has structure, has a pattern.</p>

<p>One of the etymologies of plan is <em>level or flat surface</em>. It reminds of phrases like <em>don't go under water</em>. Under water? It's like water is a 2D thing. Water for the brain is a surface. Plan is a flat surface. I don't know why my brain makes these silly connections.</p>

<p>Anyway, I think planning might not be the answer. I don't think the Cosmos plans for this reality and yet look it run!</p>
