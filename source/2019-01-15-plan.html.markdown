Planning is one of those things that humans are into it. I don't know if the reason is fear of failing, death, disappointment, etc. Maybe it's because the brain is a pattern recognition machine and a plan has structure, has a pattern.

One of the etymologies of plan is *level or flat surface*. It reminds of phrases like *don't go under water*. Under water? It's like water is a 2D thing. Water for the brain is a surface. Plan is a flat surface. I don't know why my brain makes these silly connections.

Anyway, I think planning might not be the answer. I don't think the Cosmos plans for this reality and yet look it run!
