    <p>
        Just like history is written by the winners, I think the whole achievements thing is also the same thing. We hear about this and that and how great. But
        rarely we hear about the failures. We hear about failures when it comes to shame someone or to feel superior<label for="sn-2" class="sidenote-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-2" class="sidenote-toggle">
        <span class="sidenote left">
            How you noticed there are people waiting to <mark>be offended</mark> or to jump into crazy conclusions just to <mark>denigrate</mark> someone? Jeez...
        </span>.
    </p>
    <p>
        That made me think that we are not teaching how to own your mistakes and failures. It took many years to finally start talking about them openly like it was nothing.
        It's weird, don't you think? After all, we learn by failing<label for="sn-3" class="sidenote-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-3" class="sidenote-toggle">
        <span class="sidenote">
            In fact, my bet is that we can only learning by failing or rather things are only things in comparison to something else. 
            So, winning is one side of the coin and there can only be a coin with two sides hence failing. To things to be computable, to compute, there's gotta be more than two.

        Imagine doing that in job interviews? I did, just a couple of times. And as you probably expected, it wasn't a good thing. 
        I mean, it wasn't seen as a good thing by the interviewer. I was totally fine with it.
