My bet is consciousness is an illusion. A very well perpetuate illusion. Just like the reality our brains created of whatever is really *outside*.

ATM. Alien Time Machine. Although, what I wanted to write was AMT: Analogy-making Tool. Games, all kinds, I see them as analogy-making tools. That is important since I part of the people who believes that's the key for artificial intelligence.

However, I have to confess, I don't want to create artificial intelligence since I believe existence is pain. Why would I want to *bring* something or someone to this cosmos?

I started a personal game last year without seeing how important it was.

The game consist in playing with words to create different meanings. You **c*an play, r8?. The more u play it, the more you realize how crazy the mind is. You can find meaning in everything or rather say you can make meaning after any thing.

You know what people who enjoy metal know each other? Because they *met* *al*.

You know designers are the thing? Because they are *de*sign.

You can make more complicated mixtures.

Why a *re*quest is not repeatable and instead a pet addiction?

And *so*on you get it.

You know it.
