        I like Dr. Strangelove. I find it to be a great satire not only of cold war but humans themselves<label for="sn-3" class="sidenote-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-3" class="sidenote-toggle">

            I mean, think about it. We have three major problems in the past: energy (food, water), reproduction, and not be be eaten. Now, for non-poor people, you have all of them covered and somehow you are still miseable.
            I think the trade-off was not justifiable. And if you go deeper, it might be the main reason of this overpopulation. Talk about denial of death, am I right, people?

        That's the reason for the title <mark>+</mark> it fits perfectly. So, Los geht's.

        In Nov 2019 I learned that I went to therapy when I was a child for like 3 years. I don't recall any of that but 'Am√° chose to share that piece of information before I moved to Germany.
        Apparently, I have short burst of rage and lots of energy. I remember in kindergarden to be quite active and get bored easily... a lot.
    </p>
    <p>
        In my teenage phase, I attributed all my issues to being a teenager. I was very sensitive to people's comments about me. I got overwhelmed by crowds regardless of relationship I had with them. 
        I prefer to be alone more importantly, to be alone on the roof watching the stars. I kept me calm. Computer games helped a lot but school was in the way, I only had interests in patterns (math). 
        For the rest of the classes I was a bad student.
    </p>
    <p>
        Then the time to go to university arrived. I was a still shy and lonely person but I made friends. These dudes where somehow like me. I studied physics. 
        From time to time, there were parties but I couldn't stay longer, I got weirded out. It was me of course but I dunno why I assumed that would faded it away.
    </p>
    <p>
        Somehow, can't recall how, I learned to deal with my emotions and my sensitiveness. I learned to control my levels of energy. And I noticed that I liked coding, a lot. I learned that I can spend
        hours in front of the computer just coding away... hours. So, I became a coder, programmer, a dude who whispers to computers.

        Until Aug 2020, I gave me a present: a DND test for ancestry, diet and mental disorders. I did it out of curiosity. I already knew there was sefardic descendency. What I didn't know was that I also have ashkenazi descendency.
        There is also Filipino, Manchurian, Coptic Egyptian, Senegambian and Angolan. Being mexican is truly a <mark>mezcolanza</mark><label for="sn-9" class="sidenote-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-9" class="sidenote-toggle">

            I wonder if that's what makes of the Cosmic Race. is there such thing as race?
        </span>.
    </p>
    <p>
        What got my attention was the mental disorder part<label for="sn-4" class="sidenote-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-4" class="sidenote-toggle">
        <span class="sidenote left">
            The diet part too. Apparently for my genetics it's better to follow the Nordic Diet. I guess I was meant to move close to the North pole <em>jiggles</em>. 
        </span>. The analizes says I have a lot of markers for ADHD, some for OCD and some other for Autism<label for="sn-5" class="sidenote-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-5" class="sidenote-toggle">
        <span class="sidenote">
            I forgot to mention before but I also have a constant sort of depression. I battle that by working a lot and find ways to distract myself which it's hard since I get bored easily.
        </span>. I did know those mental disorders but I wasn't aware of all the details of each one of them.
    </p>
    <p>
        Let's start with OCD. It makes sense. Sometimes I have burst of making things in order, symmetrical and beautiful aesthetic to the point that people get annoyed by me, <em>I'm sorry</em>.
        Autism. I might. I doubt it, though. The only thing I can think of it's when people say that I'm rude in some conversations. What they mean is I say things as they are instead of sugarcode them.
        But the ADHD... this one makes quite a lot of sense. It brought me peace to many of my personal issues. It brought me resolution. It wasn't easy, thought. I was in denial for days. I wanted to be normal
        even though I knew I was fucked up. 
    </p>
    <p>
        After a few days I made peace with myself. I realized that it might not be so bad. I also realized this might be why I like coding. Coding is hyperfocus to me. Coding is heaven. Coding is my happy place just like
        that roof and the stars. It can be a superpower, I just need to learn how to harness it.
    </p>
    <p>
        So I stopped worrying.
