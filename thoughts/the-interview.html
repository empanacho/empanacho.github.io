    <p>
        I'm one of those that complains about how terrible the interview process, at least in the IT context, is. I have had quite a few interviews. I have seen many diff stylists.
        They have left me with a taste of disatisfaction. The sad thing is I dunno how to fix it. I guess it's one of those art that's have to master.

        Now, a few days ago I have what I considered The Interview of my life<label for="sn-11" class="sidenote-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-11" class="sidenote-toggle">
        <span class="sidenote left">
            Before I wrote this, I tried to look for a word that expresses my feeling but I'm bad at expressing feelings so I'm sure it's easier to find the origin of the Universe than the word.
        </span>.

        I'm also the kind of people who complain about other peope saying <em>it's just business</em> as in they want to separate human emotion from the equation.
        Every time I hear that, I can't stop thinking they are just as bad as dealing with emotion than everybody else. So, it's easier to disassociate yourself.

        What was so great about that interview? We talk about my failures and vulnerabilities. No ego. No superiority complex. No fear to be exposed. They were so open and understandable. I felt so
        <em>fill-with-a-word</em>. I really don't know how to to call it. it was an amazing hour.

        I knew however I wasn't the right fit. There are most likely far better people than me... by millions. But I wanted to try, you know? In the end, I think I won.

        It's a shame, I believe, more companies don't interview like that.
