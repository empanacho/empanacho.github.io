        Since I was a child I have always have these depressions moments. I dunno why or how they happen. I tried to journal about it at some point to recognize patterns but nothing came through.
        I remember my parents wanted me to go to the psychologist but I refused. I didn't want to know I was crazy or fucked up up there.

        You can imagine a quite moody teenager. I dunno how I didn't end up being an emo or goth. I think since I tried to rationalize it somehow I <em>overcome</em> it. I still have those moments. 
        And I think that's also the reason why I ended up being a pessimist philosopher kind of guy.

        Last year, I decided to get my DNA tested<label for="sn-24" class="sidenote-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-24" class="sidenote-toggle">
        <span class="sidenote">
            I don't recommend it, though. There is a lot of shit in there that I needed to cope with. And at least for me, it was a hard process. I'm still on denial of a few things.
        </span>. After a few weeks I got my raw data and I started using it in websites that provides you more information based on markers and what-not. Before that,
        I already knew that coffee helps to keep depression aside. I don't drink too much coffee, though. I prefer earl grey tea (black tea) which also have caffeine.

        So, It turns out I have a gene called <em>CYP1A2</em> which translates into <em>Likely to be a fast metabolizer of caffeine</em>. I'm also have other genes like <em>ABCG2, BDNF, MLXIPL, EFCAB5, CYP1A1, GKCR, AHR1, and AHR</em>
        which basically means <em>tendency to consume moderate amount of coffee</em>. I guess my will is stronger since I don't drink that much caffeine.

        I remember <em>El Poderoso</em><label for="sn-25" class="sidenote-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-25" class="sidenote-toggle">

            He used to be called like that because legend has it he met <em>El Diablo</em>, a man with no face and no human feet. <em>El Diablo</em> bowed before him, my grandpa, hence the nickname.
        </span>, my grandpa from my 'am√°'s side, used to drink a lot of coffee. I guess I got that from him.
