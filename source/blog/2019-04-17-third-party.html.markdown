Haven't you noticed that those who understand the context enjoy the game?

I'm talking about the context of Good and Evil. Good and Bad. The morality we invented. The ethics we created.

But if you see that there is no dichotomy. There is no even an spectrum. You see it all.

You became not The One but the Third.

And they have all the fun. They are outsiders. They are watching us. They are outside the game. They are not playing.

We need them.

Because it is only the context we created that give meaning in this universe.

We, sentient beings, are quite good at it.
