  &lt;p&gt;Humans are a deeply flawed and a destructive species that is responsible for the suffering and deaths of billions of other humans and non-human animals. If that level of destruction were caused by another species we would rapidly recommend that new members of that species not be brought into existence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;I'd like to share a revelation that I've had during my time here. It came to me when I tried to classify your species and I realized that you're not actually mammals. Every mammal on this planet instinctively develops a natural equilibrium with the surrounding environment but you humans do not. You move to an area and you multiply and multiply until every natural resource is consumed and the only way you can survive is to spread to another area. There is another organism on this planet that follows the same pattern. Do you know what it is? A virus. Human beings are a disease, a cancer of this planet. You're a plague and we are the cure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;This little box of mine? It's my collection. Contains lots of stuff but mostly questions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To &lt;em&gt;know&lt;/em&gt; something is to what?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Til this day I have no idea what knowning actually is. I'm full of doubts and questions. Answers don't seem to be my thing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Sha'ir&lt;/em&gt;, the knower.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Human memory demands light before heavy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Shag&lt;/em&gt; a word in Akkadian that seems to mean &lt;strong&gt;in&lt;/strong&gt; or &lt;strong&gt;inside&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Is that why shagging is used to mean having sex?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Or is it just part of the Dopeler effect? Where stupid ideas tend to seem smarter when they come at you rapdly?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beats me.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Civilization as an Illusion</title>

  &lt;p&gt;Because this is the end of civilization! People like you don't want to work or learn anything because they're too busy with their remote control television or playing with their hula-hoops! And before you know it, that's where we're at!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As far as I can tell what's hold on this civilization is lying. To lie, we need some sort of communication. A channel where information flows. But information is not enough. Some sort of consciousness is neccesary.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In fact, I'm with Jaynes. To be conscious it takes what you least expect.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is once we learned to talk to each other that the gods were away. It is when we created the laws that a civilization was born. To hold millions, a mechanism like laws or a constitution was enough. It is enough.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But all that it's an illusion, I believe. It only takes a few thoughts to release that this civilization is hang on a thread.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, when will we start over?&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Some people worry that artificial intelligence will make us feel inferior, but then, anybody in his right mind should have an inferiority complex every time he looks at a flower.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In my pursue to conquer the galaxy one thing I certainly need. That is the use of artificial intelligence. My goal is to conquer myrmecology as much as possible to have an workforce that allow me, at some point, to harvest raw materials in space. However, I don't need to create dangerous artificial intelligence as some well-known celebrities are worried about to be created.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I'm worried but for entirely different reasons.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, I don't think the A.I. we'll create will be &lt;em&gt;evil&lt;/em&gt; by itself. It might be &lt;em&gt;evil&lt;/em&gt; because the humans who coded.
Second, I don't think we will reach intelligence like ours.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don't think we will reach it because of the same reason I'm not looking to create it. That is:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Existence is pain.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;I see consciousness as an illusion.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;It will be like having babes we then make slaves.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By the time we are capable of creating General Artificial Intelligence, we will seattle for less: an enhancement of our own intelligence hopefully for good.&lt;/p&gt;
