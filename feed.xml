  &lt;p&gt;Man is literally split in two: he has an awareness of his own splendid uniqueness in that he sticks out of nature with a towering majesty, and yet he goes back into the ground a few feet in order to blindly and dumbly rot and disappear forever.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The condition we all are perhaps is the reason of our self-destructive behavoir. It's like we don't want to be happy, whatever that is.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;We fight inequality in knowledge access across the world. The scientific knowledge should be available for every person regardless of their income, social status, geographical location and etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I remember that I was discourage to going into Astronomy. In his defense, my father was just protecting me. He wanted a future where I can survive after his gone. I think that shows the roots of the problem with this civilization.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I remember I got into PhD program because I was in love with science, however, I got discourage by watching how things where done in the institution I was researching. In their defense, their were looking after themselves (money and ego). So I dropped out after 4 years of working.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, I'm working on a project that will take me at least 50 years. Projects of such magnitude clearly cannot be done by one person, me. I'm well aware that I need to find other people. I depend on them. While trying to find such people, I stumbled upon the same hidden issues I mentioned before.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Why do we have to pay for scientific papers?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Why do we want to have a civilization?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Why do we say we are superior species when we clearly live by the rules of Nature?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our civilization is based on so many illusions what we are not willing to challenge. Is it our nature to be followers?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How is that that a country with 60% of poverty is ruled by the minority? By numbers, they should take the country.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Why we are still bicameral men?&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Humans are a deeply flawed and a destructive species that is responsible for the suffering and deaths of billions of other humans and non-human animals. If that level of destruction were caused by another species we would rapidly recommend that new members of that species not be brought into existence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;I'd like to share a revelation that I've had during my time here. It came to me when I tried to classify your species and I realized that you're not actually mammals. Every mammal on this planet instinctively develops a natural equilibrium with the surrounding environment but you humans do not. You move to an area and you multiply and multiply until every natural resource is consumed and the only way you can survive is to spread to another area. There is another organism on this planet that follows the same pattern. Do you know what it is? A virus. Human beings are a disease, a cancer of this planet. You're a plague and we are the cure.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;This little box of mine? It's my collection. Contains lots of stuff but mostly questions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To &lt;em&gt;know&lt;/em&gt; something is to what?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Til this day I have no idea what knowning actually is. I'm full of doubts and questions. Answers don't seem to be my thing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Sha'ir&lt;/em&gt;, the knower.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Human memory demands light before heavy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Shag&lt;/em&gt; a word in Akkadian that seems to mean &lt;strong&gt;in&lt;/strong&gt; or &lt;strong&gt;inside&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Is that why shagging is used to mean having sex?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Or is it just part of the Dopeler effect? Where stupid ideas tend to seem smarter when they come at you rapdly?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beats me.&lt;/p&gt;
