  &lt;p&gt;This little box of mine? It's my collection. Contains lots of stuff but mostly questions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To &lt;em&gt;know&lt;/em&gt; something is to what?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Til this day I have no idea what knowning actually is. I'm full of doubts and questions. Answers don't seem to be my thing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Sha'ir&lt;/em&gt;, the knower.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Human memory demands light before heavy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Shag&lt;/em&gt; a word in Akkadian that seems to mean &lt;strong&gt;in&lt;/strong&gt; or &lt;strong&gt;inside&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Is that why shagging is used to mean having sex?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Or is it just part of the Dopeler effect? Where stupid ideas tend to seem smarter when they come at you rapdly?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beats me.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Civilization as an Illusion</title>

  &lt;p&gt;Because this is the end of civilization! People like you don't want to work or learn anything because they're too busy with their remote control television or playing with their hula-hoops! And before you know it, that's where we're at!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As far as I can tell what's hold on this civilization is lying. To lie, we need some sort of communication. A channel where information flows. But information is not enough. Some sort of consciousness is neccesary.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In fact, I'm with Jaynes. To be conscious it takes what you least expect.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is once we learned to talk to each other that the gods were away. It is when we created the laws that a civilization was born. To hold millions, a mechanism like laws or a constitution was enough. It is enough.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But all that it's an illusion, I believe. It only takes a few thoughts to release that this civilization is hang on a thread.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, when will we start over?&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Some people worry that artificial intelligence will make us feel inferior, but then, anybody in his right mind should have an inferiority complex every time he looks at a flower.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In my pursue to conquer the galaxy one thing I certainly need. That is the use of artificial intelligence. My goal is to conquer myrmecology as much as possible to have an workforce that allow me, at some point, to harvest raw materials in space. However, I don't need to create dangerous artificial intelligence as some well-known celebrities are worried about to be created.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I'm worried but for entirely different reasons.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, I don't think the A.I. we'll create will be &lt;em&gt;evil&lt;/em&gt; by itself. It might be &lt;em&gt;evil&lt;/em&gt; because the humans who coded.
Second, I don't think we will reach intelligence like ours.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don't think we will reach it because of the same reason I'm not looking to create it. That is:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Existence is pain.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;I see consciousness as an illusion.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;It will be like having babes we then make slaves.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By the time we are capable of creating General Artificial Intelligence, we will seattle for less: an enhancement of our own intelligence hopefully for good.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Existential Debt</title>

  &lt;p&gt;Take it moment by moment, and you will find that we are all, as I've said before, bugs in amber.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have this proposal: &lt;em&gt;Existential Debt&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think it can be better explained by example. So here it is.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Imagine we are embarking in creating a startup. The idea is to capitalize on wood furniture. We have the trees, the tools, the workforce, we have it all. We do it all. From raw materials to the end product, we work. Everything goes fine for years and years. The question is: what is the existential debt of that startup?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The idea of the Existential Debt is that no matter what it's done, you always get some.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is based on two concepts:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Everything is interconnected and the benefit of something is merely in the context in which is examined. What seems to be &lt;em&gt;good&lt;/em&gt; for someone, it's &lt;em&gt;bad&lt;/em&gt; for someone else or something else.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Everything decays or everything is changing whichever way you want to see it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The startup to avoid screwing the forest, i.e., plants more trees. In doing so, it changes the environment around and that may cause the lives of other beings directly o indirectly. That in turn affects everything around. It goes &lt;em&gt;well&lt;/em&gt; since the startup goes on and the reforestation happens but something get messed up in the process.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The startup to avoid chemical wasted, invests in research and finds a way to stop screwing the environment. In doing so, something is affected.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In other words, there is no free lunch. Something changes for &lt;em&gt;good&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;bad&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Briefly:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a Cosmos where there is no meaning, only the one that sentient beings choose to have, the Existential Debt is an idea that helps to be aware of our actions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This came to me while I was reading a book on systems thinking.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Games as ATM</title>

  &lt;p&gt;In the end, we self-perceiving, self-inventing, locked-in mirages are little miracles of self-reference.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My bet is consciousness is an illusion. A very well perpetuate illusion. Just like the reality our brains created of whatever is really &lt;em&gt;outside&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;ATM. Alien Time Machine. Although, what I wanted to write was AMT: Analogy-making Tool. Games, all kinds, I see them as analogy-making tools. That is important since I part of the people who believes that's the key for artificial intelligence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, I have to confess, I don't want to create artificial intelligence since I believe existence is pain. Why would I want to &lt;em&gt;bring&lt;/em&gt; something or someone to this cosmos?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I started a personal game last year without seeing how important it was.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The game consist in playing with words to create different meanings. You &lt;em&gt;*c&lt;/em&gt;an play, r8?. The more u play it, the more you realize how crazy the mind is. You can find meaning in everything or rather say you can make meaning after any thing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You know what people who enjoy metal know each other? Because they &lt;em&gt;met&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;al&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You know designers are the thing? Because they are &lt;em&gt;de&lt;/em&gt;sign.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can make more complicated mixtures.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Why a &lt;em&gt;re&lt;/em&gt;quest is not repeatable and instead a pet addiction?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And &lt;em&gt;so&lt;/em&gt;on you get it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You know it.&lt;/p&gt;
