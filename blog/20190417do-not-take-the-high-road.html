     Well, you get here. And for that I'll tell you something to be either entertained or bored, your choice.

     You probably know the expression "Know thyself". I've been 35 years on this planet and until now I found
     my "calling". I do not believe there are such things but I do believe we can choose our future (part of it).
     So, I have this vision where we can conquer the galaxy. Although I'd say "I" because I'll be alone in the beginning but my
     hope is that there are crazy human beings who happens to want the same.
     It's not simple and most likely "I" won't make it but I want to play the game.

     Our existence is so ephemeral in comparison with most things in the Universe or Multiverse.
     It is also meaningless.
     You probably won't understand this BUT those two things are the fuel to my
     silly existence.

      Do Not Take The High Road

      <p>Or take, not my choice.</p>

<p>But here is the thing. I think we got it wrong.</p>

<p>The road to perfection is pain.</p>

<p>The road to perfection is failure.</p>

<p>I think we got it wrong. There is no destiny. No fate. No meaning. This is just it. But we can create destiny. We can create fate. We create meaning every single moment. That's what the brain does.</p>

<p>So, the brain does better things by failing which it is the only way to learn. It needs data, all kind of data. The more, the better. Ones the brains figure things out, you get bored. You need something else. It needs to keep moving or it goes crazy. Private your sense and see it for yourself.</p>

<p>From A to B. But you need be to be impossible otherwise you will need another point. And another. And another. Stop.</p>

<p>Do not take the high road. We made that up. Instead, think. What is the right thing to do? What's right? Don't be lazy. Think. Analyze. Don't expect answers. Just think for youself.</p>

<p>Do not take the high road. There is no such thing. It's only a context to play around. Play the game. But not theirs. Play your game.</p>

<p>Just don't take it too serious.</p>
